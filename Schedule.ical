DESCRIPTION:We already know that C and C++ support structures the same way 
 (at least for now). So let's continue with some data structures. But befor
 e we continue\, be sure to read up on the lecture about malloc/new for dyn
 amic memory allocation. It will prove helpful here.\n\nWe want to create a
  queue data structure. Remember from CS 2420 that a queue is a FIFO (first
 -in-first-out) data structure. When we add to the queue\, we always add to
  the end by appending or enqueueing. When we remove from the queue\, we al
 ways remove from the front by dequeuing. \n\nFor this\, we will implement
  a Node structure (like we did in the previous homework)\, but it will be 
 written in C++ instead of C. Since this is a reusing of some old code\, it
  should be fairly easy.\n\nIn queue.h and queue.cpp\, write the followin
 g:\n\nCreate a Node structure that has the following members:\n\n* A doubl
 e that stores the value\n\n* A Node pointer that stores the reference to t
 he next node in the queue\n\nAlso write the following functions:\n\n* crea
 te_queue() : this function takes in a double and returns the head of the q
 ueue given by a Node (or Node pointer) who's value is the input and who's 
 next node is the null pointer\n\n* enqueue() : this function takes in a do
 uble and the head of the queue and creates a new Node in the queue who's v
 alue is the double input and who's next node is the null pointer\n\n* dequ
 eue() : this function takes in the head of the queue and removes it from t
 he queue\, making the next Node in the queue the new head\, and returns th
 e Node that it dequeued. Note: if you are using Node pointers\, you may ne
 ed a double pointer (pointer to a pointer).\n\n* print_queue() : this func
 tion takes in the head of the queue and iterates through the queue printin
 g the value and the position in the queue (starting at 0). The format shou
 ld be:\nposition: value\n\n* delete_queue() : this function takes in the h
 ead of the queue and iterates through the queue\, deleting the memory that
  was allocated to it\, and setting each Node pointer to the null pointer. 
 Note: if you are using Node pointers\, you may need a double pointer (poin
 ter to a pointer).\n\nIn main.cpp write the following:\n\nWrite a main() f
 unction that presents a menu with the following options:\n\n* Create Queue
 \n\n* Enqueue\n\n* Dequeue\n\n* Print Queue\n\n* Quit\n\nMake sure to use 
 a non-infinite while loop to loop until the user chooses to quit and valid
 ate all user input. When the user chooses to quit\, be sure to free up any
  memory that's been allocated dynamically.\n\nNote: If you want to do furt
 her reading\, you can look at how we would create a data structure that is
  "type agnostic". This means that the structure itself does not determine 
 the data type that it stores as the value of the node (in this case a doub
 le)\, but that ANY data type can be placed there. This means that our queu
 e can be utilized for any data type\, including ones we create.

DESCRIPTION:------------------------\nPHP and SQL Assignment 5\n-----------
 -------------\n\n Assignment Instruction\n-----------------------\n\nPurp
 ose of this Assignment\n--------------------------\n\nUse PHP and SQL to g
 enerate webpages with form elements\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nStart
  with the page you created earlier in the semester.  For a reference\, he
 re was the starting page: [AttendingSUU.html] (https://lumos.csis.suu.edu/
 ~barkern/CS_4350/AttendingSUU.html)\n\nYou will also need this sql code\n\
 n* Code to create an initial table to pull from [user_inputs_for_all_pages
 .sql] (https://lumos.csis.suu.edu/~barkern/CS_4350/user_inputs_for_all_pag
 es.sql)\n\n* Code to use when you match the 'select' option [info_for_sele
 ct_and_radio_input.sql] (https://lumos.csis.suu.edu/~barkern/CS_4350/info_
 for_select_and_radio_input.sql)\n\nFor this assignment I would like you to
  use PHP and SQL to work with form elements under the following scenario:\
 nYou are working on website pages that users will fill out when they first
  attend SUU\n\nDatabase Tasks:\n\n* Use the sql files above to create tabl
 es in your sql database\n\n* Create a third table in your database where y
 ou will store the data items.  You are welcome to create all the rows\, b
 ut only page one items are required for this assignment.  Be sure to sele
 ct proper datatypes\n\n* Note: Populating the database will be in the next
  assignment\n\nPHP Tasks:\n\nGoal: have PHP dynamically create the webpage
 s we created earlier in the semester\n\n* Have your PHP script pull the pa
 ge 1 items from the sql table and display them on the webpage with their a
 ssociated text_for_display\n\n* When your script hits the 'select' item fo
 r the major\, pull from the second table above to populate the dropdown. 
  Keep the alphabetical order\, so use the command that orders by the prope
 r column\n\n* Instead of using JavaScript\, use PHP to fill in the initial
  value for the date input to be today's date\n\nJavaScript Tasks:\n\n* All
  JavaScript should be removed from your page\, unless you want to leave th
 e 'Random Student' button\n\nOther Tasks:\n\n* Verify your code using the 
 following website\n\n* https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input\n\n* In
 clude a screenshot of your validated code in your report\n\n* Include a sc
 reenshot of the get request url in your report.  This helps me see that a
 ll input items are appropriately connected\n\n* for example assignment.htm
 l?name=DrB&course=CS%204350\n\nSubmission\n----------\n\nPlease submit the
  following files:\n\n* Your php/html page(s)\n\n* A basic report with appr
 opriate screenshots\n\nGrading of Assignment\n---------------------\n\n* D
 atabase Tasks: 10 points\n\n* PHP Tasks: 15 points\n\n* Other Tasks: 5 poi

 -------------\n\n Assignment Instruction\n-----------------------\n\nPurp
 ose of this Assignment\n--------------------------\n\nGet experience worki
 ng with phpMyAdmin and populating a database from a file\n\nInstructions\n
 ------------\n\n* For this assignment I would like you to setup a database
  for the following file: [HP_Chapters.csv] (https://suu.instructure.com/co
 urses/1048413/files/180766257?wrap=1)\n\n* Creating a table using phpMyAdm
 in:\n\n* Start your webserver and sql server then navigate to phpMyAdmin a
 nd create a table using their interface \n\n* Note the following:\n\n* Th
 ere are two columns that are strings\n\n* The rest of the columns are numb
 ers - small-ish numbers\, so you can save some space on some of the column
 s by choosing a smaller value\n\n* You need a key.  Although you can auto
 generate a key\, there is a column that likely could be used as the key\n\
 n* Populating the database\n\n* There are many ways to get the data into t
 he database\, but I would like you to get some practice with php\, and usi
 ng php to create sql commands\n\n* First put the csv file into a folder on
  your webserver so your php file\, created in the next step\, can ready it
 \n\n* Create a php file that will do the following\n\n* Use php to open th
 e file.  A quick web search can give you the command and examples\, but e
 ssentially\n\n* $myfile = fopen("filename"\, "r") or die("Unable to ope
 n file")\;\n\n* Read a line of data\n\n* $line = fgets($myfile)\;\n\n* Spl
 it the line on the commas\n\n* $pieces = explode("\,"\, $line)\;\n\n* e
 cho $pieces[0]\; // piece1\n\n* echo $pieces[1]\; // piece2\n\n* Setup 
 the database connection\, and add things into the database.  Note that th
 e following is just an example\, and you will have to edit it for your own
  table\n\n*\n\n$servername = "localhost"\;\n$username = "username"\;\n$pas
 sword = "password"\;\n$dbname = "myDB"\;\n\n// Create connection\n$conn = 
 new mysqli($servername\, $username\, $password\, $dbname)\;\n// Check conn
 ection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n  die("Connection failed: " . $conn-
 >connect_error)\;\n}\n\n$sql = "INSERT INTO MyGuests (firstname\, lastname
 \, email)\nVALUES ('John'\, 'Doe'\, 'john@example.com')"\;\n\nif ($conn->q
 uery($sql) === TRUE) {\n  echo "New record created successfully"\;\n} els
 e {\n  echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error\;\n}\n\n$conn->close
 ()\;\n\n* Create a page to show the data\n\n* You can start with something
  like this - I did add some of the headers\, but didn't fix everything for
  you :)\n\n*\n\n$servername = "localhost"\;\n$username = "username"\;\n$pa
 ssword = "password"\;\n$dbname = "myDB"\;\n\n// Create connection\n$conn =
  new mysqli($servername\, $username\, $password\, $dbname)\;\n// Check con
 nection\nif ($conn->connect_error) {\n  die("Connection failed: " . $conn
 ->connect_error)\;\n}\n\n$sql = "SELECT id\, firstname\, lastname FROM MyG
 uests WHERE lastname='Doe'"\;\n$result = $conn->query($sql)\;\n\nif ($resu
 lt->num_rows > 0) {\n  echo "<table><tr><th>Book</th><th>Book Number</th>
 <th>Chapters Overall</th><th>Chapters in Book</th><th>Chapter key</th><th>
 Chapter Title</th><th>Page Start</th><th>Page End</th></tr>"\;\n  // outp
 ut data of each row\n  while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {\n    echo
  "<tr><td>".$row["id"]."</td><td>".$row["firstname"]." ".$row["lastname"].
 "</td></tr>"\;\n  }\n  echo "</table>"\;\n} else {\n  echo "0 results"\
 ;\n}\n$conn->close()\;\n\nSubmission\n----------\n\nPlease submit the foll
 owing files:\n\n* Submit a report (in pdf) with the following pictures\n\n
 * A picture of the database in phpMyAdmin\n\n* A picture of the page showi
 ng all the data\n\n* Upload your php file that prints the table as well\n\

 -------------\n\n Assignment Instruction\n-----------------------\n\nPurp
 ose of this Assignment\n--------------------------\n\nUse PHP and SQL to g
 enerate webpages with form elements\n\nInstructions\n------------\n\nStart
  with the page you created earlier in the semester.  For a reference\, he
 re was the starting page:\n[AttendingSUUMoreInfo.html] (https://lumos.csis
 .suu.edu/~barkern/CS_4350/AttendingSUUMoreInfo.html)\n\nFor this assignmen
 t I would like you to use PHP and SQL to work with form elements under the
  following scenario:\nYou are working on website pages that users will fil
 l out when they first attend SUU\n\nDatabase Tasks:\n\n* If you haven't al
 ready completed this task\, add rows to your table for all items on this p
 age so that there are rows for at least page 1 and page 2 data items. Be s
 ure to select proper datatypes\n\n* I have already added the hogwarts_hous
 e and the hp_character into the info_for_select_and_radio_input table.\n\n
 PHP Tasks:\n\n* Store the items that were submitted on page 1 into your da
 tabase using a PHP sql insert statement.\n\n* (Instead of using hidden opt
 ions as we did earlier)\n\n* Capture a screenshot after several inserts\, 
 so that you/me can be sure it is working\n\n* Have your PHP script pull th
 e page 2 items from the sql table and display them on the webpage with the
 ir associated text_for_display\n\n* When a select or radio option is to be
  displayed\, pull the associated data from the correct table to populate t
 he drop down and radio options\n\nJavaScript:\n\n*\n\n* You are welcome to
  leave the JavaScript that shows the Completion Score\, but all other Java
 Script should be removed\n\nOther Tasks:\n\n* Verify your code using the f
 ollowing website\n\n* https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input\n\n* Inc
 lude a screenshot of your validated code in your report\n\n* Include a scr
 eenshot of the get request url in your report.  This helps me see that al
 l input items are appropriately connected\n\n* for example assignment.html

DESCRIPTION:Write a C++ program that does the following:\n\nSimulate a payr
 oll program. Your payroll program should have two kinds of employees:\n\n*
  Full time Employees\n\n* Part time Employees\n\nEvery employee has:\n\n* 
 An Employee ID\n\n* An Employee First Name\n\n* An Employee Last Name\n\nF
 ull time employees have:\n\n* A salary\n\n* A bonus\n\n* A 401k Contributi
 on\n\n* Benefits\n\nPart time employees have:\n\n* Sick time\n\n* Wage\n\n
 * Hours worked\n\nCreate an employee base class with the following:\n\n* A
 n integer for employee ID\n\n* A string for first name\n\n* A string for l
 ast name\n\n* A constructor with all the parameters necessary to create an
  employee\n\n* A pure virtual pay() method that returns a double\n\n* A pu
 re virtural get_type() method that returns a string\n\nCreate a full time 
 employee derived class with the following:\n\n* A double for salary\n\n* A
  double for bonus\n\n* A double for 401k contribution which is 5% of their
  salary\n\n* A string vector that contains all the benefits that the emplo
 yee has opted in for\n\n* The benefits are from the following list: "medic
 al"\, "dental"\, "vision"\, "life insurance"\, "disability"\n\n* A constru
 ctor with all the parameters necessary to create an employee\n\n* Mutators
  and accessors for every derived class attribute\n\n* Salary should be gre
 ater than 0\n\n* Bonus should be 0 or greater\n\n* 401k contribution will 
 always be 5% of the current salary\n\n* A pay() method that returns the ye
 arly salary plus any bonus\n\n* A get_type() method that returns "FULL TIM
 E"\n\n* An overloaded << operator that formats the output like the followi
 ng:\n\n* Lastname\, Firstname: FULL TIME\nSalary: $salary\nBonus: $bonus\
 nBenefits: benefit1\, benefit2\, ...\n\n* If there are no benefits listed
 \, then print NONE\n\nCreate a part time employee derived class with the f
 ollowing:\n\n* A double for wage\n\n* A double for hours worked\n\n* A dou
 ble for sick time\n\n* A constructor with all the parameters necessary to 
 create an employee\n\n* Mutators and accessors for each derived class attr
 ibute\n\n* Wage should be greater than 0\n\n* Hours worked should be 0 or 
 greater\n\n* Sick time should be 0 or greater\n\n* A pay() method that ret
 urns the wage*hours worked\n\n* A get_type() method that returns "PART TIM
 E"\n\n* An overloaded << operator that formats the output like the followi
 ng:\n\n* Lastname\, Firstname: PART TIME\nWage: $wage/hour\nHours Worked:
  hours\nSick Time Accrued: sick time hours\n\nCreate a main() function t
 hat does the following:\n\n* Creates a vector of Employee pointers\n\n* Lo
 ops a menu that has the following options:\n\n* Add Fulltime employee\n\n*
  Add Parttime employee\n\n* Print Employee List\n\n* Calculate Payroll\n\n
 * Quit\n\n* If they want to add a full time employee\, ask for the pertine
 nt information\, and assign a random 5-digit employee ID to them. Add them
  to the vector\n\n* If they want to add a part time employee\, ask for the
  pertinent information\, and assign a random 5-digit employee ID to them\,
  and a random double value between 0 and 40 for their sick time. Add them 
 to the vector\n\n* If they want to print the list of employees\, use the o
 verloaded << operator to do so\n\n* If they want to calculate the total pa
